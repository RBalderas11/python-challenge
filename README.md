# python-challenge
For this week's module, we were asked to take to separate csv files and provide certain figures based on those files. I had to be able to use python to load the csv,
read it and then manipulate the data through code.
Both projects asked for a text file with the required outputs.

To run the script, it is assumed that you have python installed on your machine. 
You will need to make sure the csv files are in the same directory as the script. 
I have placed the csv files in the Resources folder as indicated in the code.

I reached out to the tutoring services for assistance with ensuring I was placing the csv file correctly. 
They also helped me with the right environment. 
I used google as well as other python resources that our instructor mentioned to help write out the code.
